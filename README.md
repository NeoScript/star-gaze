# star-gaze


## Inspiration
This project is really just something I wanted to challenge my self to do.
The intention is to create a full-stack application that will allow production
organizations to time track tasks and understand labor usage. Maybe at some
point we build in something cool for basic resource tracking. Who knows, its really
just a fun way to see what new things can be learned.


## Contributing
To get setup locally, just clone the repo and use the included .devcontainer files
in order to get started with VSCode. If you are using a different setup, I'm sure
you can figure it out :wink:, feel free to add a PR once you do.
